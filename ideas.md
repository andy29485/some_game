# Ideas Scratchpad
A place to put diffrent ideas for the game (mainly relating to the story).

## Ideas taken from Fallout 4
1. NPC dialogues change depending on the armour I'm wearing (vault suit,
   power armour, or running around naked).
2. NPC dialogues change after some missions (e.x. I saw some
   dude painting a wall and helped him, then other NPCs told me
   that the wall looked good and that I did a good job).
3. Multiple factions to join/endings to achieve.
4. I can have companions follow me around (like a dog or actual people)
   depending on what I do (kill factions they like/hate, find stuff, or
   lockpick/pickpocket in front of them) they start to like me more/less
   and possibly give me stuff.
