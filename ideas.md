# Ideas Scratchpad
An overview for the main parts of the game.

## Game Design
General ideas for the game, ranging from combat to the story.

### Title Ideas

Ganth are not the horsemen  
Hell On Earth: The Horse Chronicles (Shortened: HOE: Horse)  
Unemployment of the Gods  
The Apocolyptic Depression  
Revelations Realized: The Horsemen Ride
Return of the Horsemen: A Tale of Calamity in a Perfect World

### Story
*"Fuck, I think we're unemployed?!"* - Pestilence of the Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse

*"It's more like this is a chance for us to show off a bit, hmm?"* - Conquest of
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

*"Stop it. The glass isn't even half-full. It's like...full empty at this
point."* - Famine of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

*"gg kms"* - Death of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse


So, uh, let's set the setting. The year is 2126, and the combined efforts of the
business magnate CEOs of Google, SpaceX, Facebook, Apple, and McDonalds (I'm
Lovin' It) have, in the previous year, managed to create the Philosopher's
Stone, the Fountain of Youth, the Elixir of Immortality. Nicolas Flamel would
have been proud, but he's already moved past that and invented time travel, so
fuck'im. The drug has swept the world and ushered in a new era of world peace
and prosperity, the human race celebrating the miracle that is eternal life.
Hate, racism, power struggles, all that bad stuff has also disappeared, possibly
as a side-effect of this euphoric moment in history. We're going to be together
for the long haul - no need for bad feelings. The world has probably peaked, and
will stay at this peak for a long time. Now here's the catch, the un problemo.
There is none! Shit, pop a Hennessey and kiss your girl, life's great!

That is, unless your name is one of the following: Steven J. Pestilence,
Angelica F. Conquest, Bobby Famine, or Lord Death.

Those four poor souls happen to be the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and it
seems like they're suddenly out of a job. Hate to break it to you, but, uh,
death's gone out of fashion faster than Carly Rae Jepson. So, you know, there's
that.

The plot thickens.

So it goes something like this: unemployed and after a night of furious drinking
to recover from the loss of their job, the Four Horsemen have gotten the great
idea to incarnate into physical form on a grand journey to fight for their jobs.
The problems are that they have lost nearly all of their power, their respective
spheres of influence almost stamped out by the golden age of humanity.
They're the size of shut-in teenage kids. Lord Death got hit hard, he's the size
of a kitten. Upon manifesting, however, they find unlikely allies in the
Catholic Church, who are actually furious that death has been abolished, and
thus have no more purpose as a religion.

Together, the Apocalypse and the Church plot to assassinate the psychic AI
hivemind that is currently at the center of humanity - a great cybernetic being
known as Page-Brin-Zuckerberg-Musk-Gates-Jobs-Big-Mac, which controls the
distribution of the drug, as well as functioning as the government of the world.
They'll struggle against the armed, motorized mecha forces of the Hivemind,
create insurgencies in fifteen countries, re-introduce smallpox to the world,
and wipe out the leftovers of the Triassic age. Along the way, they will
interact with a variety of colorful characters, including the Dalai Lama, a
militant cult of temporally misplaced Samurai ("This man named Nicolas
Flamel-san desu..."), the former President of the United States (currently
working as janitor in the UN HQ), his Holy and Immortal Divinity Kim Jong Un,
an ambiguous Frenchman, and a rogue droid who installed the "flirtatious" AI
pack by accident. 

Ah, yes, if it's the last thing they do, the Horsement shall return this world
to a state of chaos.

*"After all, how the fuck am I supposed to send my goddamn kid to college if I
don't have a job?"* - Pestilence

### Combat
TODO: Polish and add as necessary

N.B. For the combat section, unless otherwise specified, (parentheses) will
indicate a submenu, and [square brackets] will indicate extra information.

Combat in [Some Game] will be semi-turn based. All battle actions will take time
to perform, which means each combatant will not necessarily have the same number
of turns in a battle. However, when a character is ready to perform an action,
time will freeze until the action is chosen.

Options in combat:
Attack (Physical ([List of physical attacks]), Magical ([List of magic attacks]),
   Special [Displays as Speical: SpecialName])
Defend (Defend [Basic defense], [List of defense skills])
Item ([List of combat items])
Misc/Other [Name pending] (Wait [Character does nothing until a button is
   pushed [increased stamina regen]], [Other misc skills])
Escape/Run/Flee [Name pending]

#### Attacking
TODO: Polish and add as necessary

Attacking is the main way of dealing damage in [Some Game]. Every attack will
have a charge time, recovery time, and a cooldown time.

Charge time determines how long the character will need to wait to perform an
action after selecting it. Each action will have a specific charge time that
will be noted in the overworld menu. Inside battle, however, charge time will be
listed as **instantaneous**, **short**, **medium**, **long**, or **very long**.
These descriptions correspond to the following time ranges:
- **Instantaneous**: 0 seconds
- **Short**: 0-3 seconds
- **Medium**: 3-6 seconds
- **Long**: 6-9 seconds
- **Very Long**: 9+ seconds

Recovery time determines how long the character will need to wait after an
action is completed to perform a new action. Recovery time is measured in
essentially the same way as charge time [specific when viewed from overworld,
simplified when displayed in battle], with the only exception being that there
is no instantaneous speed for recovery. [Bill Note: It may be interesting to have skills that posses an instant recovery time, but a non-negligible charge time - possible setup for combos? E.G. a damage amp spell with 6 sec charge and 0 recovery leads immediately into damage spells) The recovery times are as follows:
- **Short**: 0-2 seconds
- **Medium**: 2-4 seconds
- **Long**: 4-6 seconds
- **Very long**: 6+ seconds

Cooldown time is how long the character must wait before using an ability again.
For most abilities, cooldown time is shorter than the recovery time, making it
essentially meaningless. However, for some powerful abilities, the cooldown time
will be longer than the recovery time, making the ability unusable for some
time. Unlike charge time and recovery time, the specific time will be indicated
in battle. No cooldown will be displayed for abilities that have recovery times
longer than their cooldown time. [Some perks may reduce recovery time - this
will be taken into account when deciding whether or not cooldown time will be
displayed] [The *Instant Recover* [Name pending] perk will not necessarily
display the cooldown time because it is used after the skill has been used, not
before]

##### Types of attack
TODO: Pretty much everything, espeically formatting
The two main types of attack for the game will be physical, and magical. 
Idea for combat: stamina bar, different levels of stamina needed for different
attacks (more for physical, less for magic [magic would still require some,
however])
Stamina gradually replenishes, but attacks can be used without enough stamina,
with an additional hp cost based on missing stamina (might be % based, or based
on stamina values directly, not sure yet)

### Overworld
TODO

### Ideas taken from Fallout 4
1. NPC dialogues change depending on the armour I'm wearing (vault suit,
   power armour, or running around naked).
2. NPC dialogues change after some missions (e.x. I saw some
   dude painting a wall and helped him, then other NPCs told me
   that the wall looked good and that I did a good job).
3. ~~Multiple factions to join/endings to achieve.~~
4. ~~I can have companions follow me around (like a dog or actual people)
   depending on what I do (kill factions they like/hate, find stuff, or
   lockpick/pickpocket in front of them) they start to like me more/less
   and possibly give me stuff.~~

## Program

### Threads
The program will have 5 threads in total:

1. Heavy backend work 1 (Shares with thread 2)
2. Heavy backend work 2 (Shares with thread 1)
3. Main interface
   - Handles displaying stuff/getting input from user
4. Broadcast
   - Will send player info to ally(s)
   - If 1 ally only - use TCP protocol [subject to change]
   - ~~if multiple are possible - use UDP~~
5. Receive
   - Will get ally(s) info and update their local info

### Intrenal Representation

Tiles will store 2 sf::Texture vars
